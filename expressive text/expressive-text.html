                Sullen clouds are gathering fast over the black fringe of the forest.

                The palm trees in a row by the lake are smiting their heads against the 
                dismal sky; the crows with their draggled wings are silent on the tamarind 
                branches, and the eastern bank of the river is haunted by a deepening gloom.
            </p>

                Our cow is lowing loud, tied at the fence.

                Men have crowded into the flooded field to catch the fishes as they escape from 
                the overflowing ponds; the rain water is running in rills through the narrow lanes 
                like a laughing boy who has run away from his mother to tease her.

                <a class="ele">O child, the daylight is dim, and the crossing at the ferry is closed.</a>

                The sky seems to ride fast upon the madly-rushing rain; the water in the 
                river is loud and impatient; women have hastened home early from the Ganges 
                with their filled pitchers.

                wind is roaring and struggling among the bamboo branches like a wild beast 
                tangled in a net.
